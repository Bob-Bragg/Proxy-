User Guide: Proxy Requester
Proxy Requester is a Python GUI application that allows users to make HTTP/HTTPS requests through a proxy server and check if the proxy server is working.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Requests library (pip install requests)
Tkinter library (should be pre-installed with Python)
How to Use
Open the proxy_requester.py file in a Python IDE or text editor.
Run the file.
Enter the URL you want to make a request to in the "URL" entry field.
Enter the HTTP and/or HTTPS proxy server address and port number in the respective entry fields.
Click the "Check Proxy" button to check if the proxy server is working. The button will turn green if the proxy is working and red if it's not working.
If the proxy server is working, click the "Send Request" button to make a request to the URL through the proxy server. The response content will be displayed in a new window.
Click the "Proxies" button to open a webpage with a list of free proxies to use.
Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble checking the proxy server, make sure that you're entering the correct address and port number for the server.
If you're having trouble making a request through the proxy server, make sure that the URL you're trying to request is accessible through the proxy and that the proxy is not blocking the request.
If you're still having trouble, try using a different proxy server or contact the administrator of the proxy server for assistance.
